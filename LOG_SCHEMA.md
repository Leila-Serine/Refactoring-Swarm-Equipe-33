## General Structure

  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 datetime",
  "agent": "System | Auditor | Analyzer | Fixer | Toolsmith | PromptManager",
  "model": "LLM model name or N/A",
  "action": "STARTUP | CODE_ANALYSIS | FIX_ATTEMPT | FIX_SUCCESS | FIX_FAILURE",
  "details": "string OR object",
  "status": "INFO | SUCCESS | FAILURE"
}

Field Descriptions
